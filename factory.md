Factories in OOP
=================

In OOP, A factory is a function / method that returns a "fresh" object. In the latter case, the word "factory" can also refer to the object that owns such a method. The practice of using factory is itself not a "GoF design pattern". 2 GoF design patterns that internally use factories are "factory method pattern" and "abstract factory pattern".
