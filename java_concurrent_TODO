1. When does the reference become non-null?
    Foo foo = null;
    Foo foo = new Foo();
a) some time during the execution of the ctor
b) after the ctor return

2. For final field of a class, when other threads see a reference of a safely published
   object, they are guaranteed to see valid final field of that object; (see final semantics
   of JLS)

   But what can we say about non-final fields????
