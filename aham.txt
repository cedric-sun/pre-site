Apache httpd admin memo
=======================

(One and only one) mpm module must be activated.
    LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so
    > http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mpm.html
    > At the user level, MPMs appear much like other Apache httpd modules. The main difference is that one and only one MPM must be loaded into the server at any time.


Activate `authz_core_module` to use `Require` directive
    LoadModule authz_core_module modules/mod_authz_core.so

Activate a security module to let httpd relinquish root privileges.
    AH00136: Server MUST relinquish startup privileges before accepting connections.  Please ensure mod_unixd or other system security module is loaded.
    LoadModule unixd_module modules/mod_unixd.so
    this is required even when httpd is started and keeps running as a normal user

/run and /run/httpd can only be writen by root
    change PidFile
    ( ? change Mutex needed ? )

shutdown specific httpd daemon
    httpd -k graceful-stop -f $PWD/httpd.conf

<Directory directory-path>
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory
        Directory-path is either
        - the full path to a directory, or
        - a wild-card string using Unix shell-style matching.

    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/directive-dict.html
        directory-path
        The path to a directory in the local file-system beginning with the root directory as in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/path/to/.

    Interesting enough when work in debug mode (-X), actually relative path works, and is relative to ServerRoot. Without -X, absolute path is required. This behavior is not documented.

    httpd -f /home/ced/httpd2nd_inst/httpd.conf -X
    [ced@ARCH3 ~]$ curl localhost:8080/index.txt
    hello world
    
    httpd -f /home/ced/httpd2nd_inst/httpd.conf
    [ced@ARCH3 ~]$ curl localhost:8080/index.txt
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
    <html><head>
    <title>403 Forbidden</title>
    </head><body>
    <h1>Forbidden</h1>
    <p>You don't have permission to access this resource.</p>
    </body></html>

Dump parsed config
    LoadModule info_module modules/mod_info.so
    httpd -t -DDUMP_CONFIG

prefixed uri path
    There is such thing "nested <Location>". You always need
        <Location /foo></Location>
        <Location /foo/bar></Location>

not really dig into the config merging rules
    merging configs seems always a complicated thing. recalling servlet 4.0 web-fragment.xml stuff.

Enable auto-supplying a index file when a directory is requested
    LoadModule dir_module modules/mod_dir.so
    DirectoryIndex index.txt

Display directory content list when no DirectoryIndex specified file is found
    LoadModule autoindex_module modules/mod_autoindex.so
    TODO: config

Trailing slash handling when mapping to fs
                                            dir              normal file
    request end with slash          DirectoryIndex                404
    request not end with slash              301                 supply

    RFC7230 5.3.1
    > If the target URI's path component is empty, the client MUST send "/" as the path within the origin-form of request-target.

Dependency .so is not loaded automatically
    when used as reverse proxy, loading mod_proxy is not enough.
    mod_proxy depends on mod_proxy_http to work
    both need to be loaded manually
