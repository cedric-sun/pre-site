viewport dissect
====
In order to support features like zoom, browser usually tell js runtime a simulated viewport size. On my HD 1080 (1920x1080) monitor, 150% zoomed linux chrome this is ...
```
window.innerWidth=
window.innerHeight=
```

On a 125% system-wide scaled window pc with unscaled chrome this is `xxx * 1536`
