Anyway, it's a problem to assemble the HTMLs snippets with gulp.

- transformation stream is bad
- use gulp task is bad, need handle the order of task ...
- the fact that gulp work with files cheat me into the trap of using tasks all the time

Later I realize this is far from ideal. ... . I realize that I'd better take a look at how other "templating" things do. The first thing I turned to was the golang 'text/template'. Later I worked with mustache.js.


## Put data into placeholders are NOT enough.

## Are template loaded from file? (or can it?)


## YOUR PARTIALS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
Many of those template engine claim that they support "partials",
 but really, they allow you to "refer to partials" but never "define partials"
mustache.js
handlebar.js
