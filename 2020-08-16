Gnome .desktop file
=====
Jetbrains seems to like creating 2 set of .desktop files for compatibility.
```bash
[ced@ARCH3 tmp]$ cat comp 
#!/bin/bash

PREFIX0='/home/ced/.gnome/apps'
PREFIX1='/home/ced/.local/share/applications'

# note $path0 is absolute path due to expansion rule
for path0 in $PREFIX0/*; do
    # echo $path0
    basef=$(basename -- $path0)
    # echo $basef
    path1="$PREFIX1/$basef"
    # echo $path1
    if [[ -f $path1 ]]; then
        echo "diff $path0 $path1"
        diff "$path0" "$path1"
    fi
done
[ced@ARCH3 tmp]$ ./comp
