process runtime files that reside on filesystem (FHS memo)
=============
/run must be "cleared" between system boot - required by FHS.
    program must have subdirectory rather than direct put files there.
    pid file must be put here. - robustness principle
    domain socket must be placed here

/var
/tmp


URI trailing slash in HTTP
==========================
Some implementation can send a 3xx to redirect client to a slash-appended uri - see servlet 4.0 and tomcat docs (mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled and  mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled)

while some site is configured to just 404, e.g.
    - `https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s15.html` works while
    - `https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s15.html/` returns 404 (apache httpd)

doesn't really have a standard on this , and is completely upto admin and implementation choices.


you can't really avoid non-printables
=====================================
there are workarounds for you to NOT write non-printables in code.
    Bash $PS1 promise to expand \e to \033

there also even tricks:
    sed -e 's/'$(echo "octal-value")'/replace-word/g'

Not consistent. you have to use the above echo trick sometimes

ANSI escape
===========
terminal is represented as a file descriptor. Normally it also behaves as a file: it records (print) whatever you write to it.
But writing some pre-defined sequence of bytes (that is intentionally hard to occur naturally) is used to change behaviors of 
the tty (display devices).

This is a type of in-band control.

man 4 console_codes

open new fd for current bash
    exec 100<file

Bash behavior when receiving end of a pipe is not a simple program
==========================================================
Every single simple program (that will eventually be a separate process) or a bash builtin that has the concept of emulated stdin, in the function or while construct, will have their stdin all from the same pipe.

### function
```bash
[ced@ARCH3 ~]$ fooo() {
> head -c3 -
> echo
> head -c3 -
> echo
> head -c3 -
> echo
> }
[ced@ARCH3 ~]$ echo '123abc999ggg' | fooo
123
abc
999
```

### while
```
[ced@ARCH3 ~]$ echo -e '123abcxxx\n000\n' | while read data; do   echo $data;   head -c1;   echo; done
123abcxxx
0
00


```

ssl equivalent to nc file transmission
======================================
openssl s_server
openssl s_client

command echo not bringing a new process
    still using bash builtin

PK Cert
====
the one who wants to prove the identity of himself needs to send the cert
the one who is receiving the certificate needs to trust the issuer

sed extract line range
====
sed -n '16224,16482p;16483q' filename > newfile

Find largest files in directory tree
====================================
```bash
